# Data Science Template

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

_Adapted to Region Västra Götaland's data science processes._

## Start your new Python or R project from our template!
You can choose which language to use when selecting interpreter. By using our template you can easily create reproducible data science projects to share with your colleagues.

You will get:
 - Folder structure
 - Documentation
 - Tools for reproducibility
 - Dockerfile with Python installed
 - (if selected) R + RStudio Server

You will **NOT** get:
 - Messy projects
 - Things that only work on your machine

### Requirements to install and use the project templating tool:
-----------
 - Python 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/Vastra-Gotalandsregionen/data-science-template

### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this: 
```
